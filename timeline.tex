Figure~\ref{fig:sched} shows a timeline for this proposal. Broadly, all the research tasks mentioned in this proposal will be conducted by 1 Ph.D. student at the University of Virginia. All research activities will be supervised by PI Hassan. As reflected in the proposed budget, we anticipate that the majority of this work will be conducted during the academic year. In the summer, we will encourage the student to participate in research-based internships at companies investigating technologies related to our proposal. This will offer them an invaluable opportunity to hone their professional skills, providing them with insights and expertise that could further refine and enhance the proposed work.
