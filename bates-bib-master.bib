	Abstract = {Several alert correlation approaches have been proposed to date to reduce the number of non-relevant alerts and false positives typically generated by Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Inspired by the mental process of the contextualisation used by security analysts to weed out less relevant alerts, some of these approaches have tried to incorporate contextual information such as: type of systems, applications, users, and networks into the correlation process. However, these approaches are not flexible as they only perform correlation based on the narrowly defined contexts. information resources available to the security analysts while preserving the maximum flexibility and the power of abstraction in both the definition and the usage of such concepts, we propose ONTIDS, a context-aware and ontology-based alert correlation framework that uses ontologies to represent and store the alerts information, alerts context, vulnerability information, and the attack scenarios. ONTIDS employs simple ontology logic rules written in Semantic Query-enhance Web Rule Language (SQWRL) to correlate and filter out non-relevant alerts. We illustrate the potential usefulness and the flexibility of ONTIDS by employing its reference implementation on two separate case studies, inspired from the DARPA 2000 and UNB ISCX IDS evaluation datasets.},

	Abstract = {We describe a mission-impact-based approach to the analysis of security alerts produced by spatially distributed heterogeneous information security (INFOSEC) devices, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, authentication services, and antivirus software. The intent of this work is to deliver an automated capability to reduce the time and cost of managing multiple INFOSEC devices through a strategy of topology analysis, alert prioritization, and common attribute-based alert aggregation. Our efforts to date have led to the development of a prototype system called the EMERALD Mission Impact Intrusion Report Correlation System, or M-Correlator. M-Correlator is intended to provide analysts (at all experience levels) a powerful capability to automatically fuse together and isolate those INFOSEC alerts that represent the greatest threat to the health and security of their networks.},

	Abstract = {Provenance-based Access Control (PBAC) has recently risen as an effective access control approach that can utilize readily provided history information of underlying systems to enhance various aspects of access control in a computing environment. The adoption of PBAC capabilities to the authorization engine of a multi-tenant cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) such as OpenStack can enhance the access control capabilities of cloud systems. Toward this purpose, we introduce tenant-awareness to the PBAC                                  C                 [14] model by capturing tenant as contextual information in the attribute provenance data. Built on this model, we present a cloud service architecture that provides PBAC authorization service and management. We discuss in depth the variations of PBAC authorization deployment architecture within the OpenStack platform and implement a proof-of-concept prototype. We analyze the initial experimental results and discuss approaches for potential improvements.},

The signature system can sign an unlimited number of messages, and the signature size increases logarithmically as a function of the number of messages signed. Signature size in a `typical' system might range from a few hundred bytes to a few kilobytes, and generation of a signature might require a few hundred to a few thousand computations of the underlying conventional encryption function.},

These algorithms are justified by theorems, and examples are given. The first section contains a brief introduction to state graphs and the regular-expression language.},

	Abstract = {In the context of software, provenance holds the key to retaining a mirror instance of the lifespan of a service, which can be replayed/reproduced from the beginning. This entails the nature of invocations that took place, how/where the data were created, modified, updated and the user's engagement with the service. With such an encyclopedia of information, it opens up a diversity of value-added features (compliance control, accountability) that can improve the usability of a service.

In this paper, we extend our previous work on the provenance-based policy language (cProvl) and model (cProv) by proposing a preliminary policy control framework. The framework provides the necessary building blocks for integrating and developing services that are able to generate and use provenance data for provenance-based compliance control, which runs on a XACML engine. We demonstrate the capability of the framework by applying it to a service case, and conduct benchmarks to determine its scalability and performance.},

	Abstract = {An accountable system is defined as a system that makes information usage transparent so that it can be determined later whether the use of such information is appropriate or not under a given set of rules. Weitzner et al. have argued that provenance could be used in the creation of accountable systems helping users to answer questions related to the processing of information. Provenance consists of causal dependencies between data and events explaining what contributed to a result in a specific state. If provenance of data is available, processing becomes transparent since the provenance of data can be analysed against usage rules to decide whether processing was performed in compliance with such rules.},

    abstract = {Smart homes include hundreds of devices that generate messages, and communicate with each other and the world outside the home, to provide a highly functional, optimized and personalized environment for residents. A secure and reliable event logging system is an essential component of smart homes with a wide range of applications such as fault detection, forensics and accounting. Existing smart home {IoT} frameworks are cloud-based and privacy of fine-grained log data is a real concern. In this paper we propose a host-based conceptual framework for storing and processing data in smart homes, analyze security requirements of such environments and design a forward secure event logging system that satisfies these environments. We give an overview of our implementation of a message (event) logging system for a typical home, and present efficiency evaluation of our cryptographic design.},
