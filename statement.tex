  \section*{Abstract}
  Modern cloud-native applications create sophisticated, multi-layered attack surfaces that traditional security tools struggle to defend effectively. Tools such as CNAPPs, EDRs, and cloud logging solutions typically operate in isolation, producing fragmented alerts and failing to detect or explain complex, multi-stage threats, such as MOVEit and Log4Shell. We propose Provenance-based Cloud Application Detection and Response (P-CADR), constructing Cross-Layer Provenance Graphs (CPGs) for unified causal reasoning across application, kernel, and cloud layers. Our approach includes an eBPF-based observability layer for real-time telemetry, advanced event correlation for real-time CPG construction, and an anomaly detection engine using supervised Graph Neural Networks. We integrate embedding recycling for efficiency and explainability tools for analyst validation. By adopting P-CADR, organizations gain unprecedented clarity into their cloud environments, enabling precise, actionable, and proactive threat management.
