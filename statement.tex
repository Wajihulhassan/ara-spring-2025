  \section*{Abstract}

  As cloud providers face increasingly sophisticated Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), scalable Cloud Detection and Response (CDR) systems are essential. Centralized threat detection in cloud environments struggles to handle the vast volume of audit logs generated by distributed worker nodes, creating significant data transfer overhead, network congestion, and slower response times. Additionally, manual investigation of CDR alerts by Security Operations Centers (SOCs) is slow and prone to error, highlighting the need for scalable, automated solutions. This proposal introduces a novel framework that addresses these limitations through a two-pronged approach: decentralized threat detection and AI-assisted alert investigation. By processing threat insights locally on each node using federated learning and Graph Neural Networks, the proposed \Sysa system reduces data transfer overhead and enhances scalability. To further improve SOC efficiency, the proposal introduces \Sysb, an AI-driven assistant that automates the generation of investigation queries for analyzing audit logs stored in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems. Leveraging a pre-trained language model, \Sysb translates SOC prompts into optimized queries, streamlining investigations and reducing the need for manual analysis. This combined approach aims to significantly enhance cloud security by enabling more efficient threat detection and response.
